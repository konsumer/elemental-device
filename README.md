# elemental-device

A javascript-based synth/effect platform for making cool audio devices with pi & [elementary](https://github.com/nick-thompson/elementary).

## WORK IN PROGRESS

This is not at all complete.

I'm still putting together ideas form these projects:

- [pdpi](https://github.com/konsumer/pdpi)
- [pipurr](https://github.com/konsumer/pipurr)
- [beatstep](https://github.com/konsumer/beatstep)

First I'll build an initial device/emulator description that can load elementary "engine patches", and then maybe I will design some other device-types. I think coupling emulator with the loader program will make it easy to easly suport differnt types of devices, and make testing/design simpler.
